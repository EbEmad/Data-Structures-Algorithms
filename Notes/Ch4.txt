What is divide & Conquer?
- Divide  : the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
-Conquer : the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
-Combine : the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
--- The main idea:
1- Divide the array into 2 pieces
2- Merge sort them 
3- Merge the 2 sorted pieces O(n)
--- so here  is the question?
- why we need to these three steps in our solution?
ans:first if we find a brute force for this kind of problemes like find the maximumsubarraysum we will think about using
two for loops so the complexity o(n^2) so is there any chance to improve our complexity?
yes:we have we can divide each problem into smaller subproblems and then if we reach to the smallest unit means
"the length of subproblem equal to 1 then it's the solution then we seek to combine the smaller subproblems to maximize or get the maximum 
subarraysum "by doing these steps we we've improved our complexity which become O(nlogn)
