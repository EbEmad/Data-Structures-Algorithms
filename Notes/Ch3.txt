-Growth of functions :
.The order of growth of the running time of an algorithm and gives a simple characterization of the algorithmâ€™s efficiency and also allows us to compare the relative performance of alternative algorithm 
.When we look at input sizes large enough to make only the order of growth of the running time relevant, we are studying the asymptotic efficiency of algorithms.
"we are concerned with how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input in the limit, as the size of the input increases without bound. "
-Asymptotic notation :
.The notations we use to describe the asymptotic running time of an algorithm are defined in terms of functions whose domains are the set of natural numbers N ={0; 1; 2; : : :}.
.we wish to characterize the running time no matter what the input. In other words, we often wish to make a blanket statement that covers all inputs, not just the worst case. We shall see asymptotic notations that are well suited to characterizing running times no matter what the input
-there are three types of notations :
1-Big    O   : gives the upper bound  
2-Big  theta : bounds the function to withen a constant factor means that the funcyions lies between O and Omega
3-Big  Omega : gives the lower bound
